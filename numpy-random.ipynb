    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a very popular open source library comprised of multidimensional array objects, mathematical functions, linear algebra<br>\n",
    "routines, random number generators and more [1]. The library is very popular due to its high level syntax and ability to perform rapid data operations.<br>\n",
    "One can explain the speed by looking deeper at how the package operates. Data structures known as ndarrays (N-dimensional arrays) only accept data of<br>\n",
    "the same type and then map these data structured to highly optimised C compiled code [2]. As Soklaski 2020 describes, this process of vectorization is<br>\n",
    "so effective when compared to iterating lists and tuples as the ndarrays dont have to check every elements data-type on iteration, resulting in a process<br>\n",
    "that is orders of magniture faster.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's operational speed and diversity of mathematical functions make the package of great utility for tasks that involve numerical processing on large<br>\n",
    "datasets, such as Machine Learning. The package also provides a very useful module for generating random numbers that will now be explored, a package<br>\n",

    "science or machine learning applications. Considering that certain real world phenomena follow predictable distibutions when the sample size is of sufficient<br> \n",
    "scale, one can generate a model and make predictons. An example of this would be modelling population as a *normal distribtuion* (bell-curve shape) and using<br> \n",
    "this model to make predictions on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the offical documnetation the random sub-module functions can be categorized into the following: <br>\n",
    "- *Simple random data* functions that can generate pseudo-random data arrays. \n",
    "- *Permutations* function that are used to randomly modify a sequence.\n",
    "- *Distribution* functions that use randomly generated arrays to sample from a chosen statistical distribtuion.<br>\n"

    "The BitGenerators produces an array of random bits which which are passed to a generator, which can be used to model different probability distributions.<br>\n",
    "One can call the *default_rng()* constructor to instansiate an object of the Generator Class and then apply *simple random data* functions that belong to the class.<br> Before exploring this further lets import the relevant libraries and define histogram functions for future use."
