&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOTE:(Link to nb viewer page for static view above)
   - Contains overview of the numpy.random Python package, through use of descriptions, code, and plots.
   - Details how to use simple random data functions and permutation fuctions.
   - Models real world scenario's with different probability distributions.
   - Explores the use of seeding generators.
   - Compares numPys current default bit generator (PCG64) to previous (MT19937).<br>
        
<br>      

#### 2. requirements.txt file:
This file contains the packages necessary to run the jupyter notebook.
<br>

#### 3. Folders:
- Images Folder: Contains one image used in jupyter notebook.
- numpy_data_sets Folder: Contains one csv file on people's height (used for normal distribution comparison).

<br>

### How to run the notebook

- Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) for python interpreter and all libraries used in notebook. NumPy will need to
updated from Anaconda's current version to the most recent version via <br>*"-m pip install numpy==<1.21.4>"*. Alternatively the individual libraries needed can be downloaded by leveraging the requirements.txt file via the following command <br>*"pip install -r requirements.txt"*.
as per *Note* below.
- Download [cmder](https://cmder.net/) if working on a Windows Operating System, alternatively use the basic *command line interface* if working on a Linux or Mac operating system.
- Clone [repository](https://github.com/CiaranMoran27/numpy.random) as laid out [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Run '*jupyter lab*' command on the command line to open the repository in Jupyter Lab.
